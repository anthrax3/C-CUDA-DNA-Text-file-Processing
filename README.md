# C-CUDA-DNA-Text-file-Processing
This program parses a file containing DNA information, namely a large codon sequence and proceeds to register the occurrences of each codon. After completion, the function then return a list containing an overview of the total presence of codons in the sequence parsed; this information can be used by biologists to perform different kinds of statistical analysis.
